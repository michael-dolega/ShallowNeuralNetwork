Using simple Neural Network to solve XOR problem

Notes:

The Python code is losely modeled on a GeeksforGeeks tutorial on backpropagation in neural networks.

This code is intended as a practice exercise.

Defining the logic facilitates the understanding of the NN architecture.

It also solidifies the importance of activation functions, and their use in gradient calculations.
